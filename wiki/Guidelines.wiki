Prefab SVN guidelines and rules
----

= Rules =
  # Don't be a jerk.
  # Give credit where credit is due. 
  # Don't upload stuff from Valve's  maps or stuff you didn't create. 
  # Expect anything uploaded to be used by anyone else in their own projects. 
  # Be willing to accept criticism and fix mistakes.

= Best practices =

  * *Keep prefabs simple.*

    - Some details and textures are OK. But don't use or include custom textures.

    - Keep it on the grid.

    - Make it basic enough so that whoever uses it will want to improvise further with their own details.

    - Exclude overlays, and other entities that don't copy well.

    - Keep props to a minimum, unless they're absolutely part of the prefab (destructible walls and such) then they're OK.

  * *Adding your files* _(still need to work out how to do this neatly)_

    - Just the .VMF files, keep it clean and accurate.

    - An accompanying ReadMe file explaining what we can expect to find in said VMFs that's the same as your file name (except with a txt extension obviously). Until we can come up with a naming scheme that works not requiring these.
